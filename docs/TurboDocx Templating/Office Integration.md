### While Editing

**What you'll see:**

- Use track changes, comments, and formatting tools
- Save your work frequently (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
- Work offline - changes sync when you're back online

**What happens automatically:**

:::warning Important: What Happens After "I'm Done Editing"

## Troubleshooting

### "Office Won't Open" Issues

**Problem:** Clicking "Open in Word" doesn't open the document

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Office Installation** - Make sure Microsoft Office is installed and activated
2. **Try a Different Browser** - Edge works best, Chrome is also good
3. **Allow Pop-ups** - Your browser might be blocking the Office protocol
4. **Restart Your Browser** - Close all tabs and restart
5. **Clear Cache** - Clear your browser cache and cookies

### "Can't Save" Issues

**Problem:** Getting errors when trying to save in Word/PowerPoint

**Most Common Cause:** You clicked "I'm Done Editing" but Office is still open

**Solution:** This is normal behavior! Once you click "I'm Done Editing", Word becomes read-only to prevent conflicts.

**To continue editing:**
1. Go back to TurboDocx in your browser
2. Click "Open in Word" again
3. This starts a new editing session with save permissions

**Other Save Issues:**
- **Check your internet connection** - Saves need an internet connection
- **Make sure no one else is editing** - Only one person can edit at a time
- **Try saving again** - Sometimes network delays cause temporary save failures

### "Document is Locked" Messages

**Problem:** TurboDocx says the document is being edited by someone else

**What this means:** Another user currently has the document open for editing

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for them to finish** - They'll click "I'm Done Editing" when finished
2. **Contact the person** - Ask them if they're still actively editing
3. **Admin can force unlock** - If you're an admin and the person isn't responding

### "Long Delay" When Opening Word

**Problem:** Word takes 10+ seconds to open after making template changes

**Why this happens:** TurboDocx is processing your template variable changes

**Solutions:**
- **Be patient** - This is normal after variable updates
- **Don't click multiple times** - Wait for Word to open
- **Check your internet speed** - Slow connections take longer

## Tips for Best Results

### Save Frequently
- Press **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) often
- Don't rely on auto-save - manual saves sync faster
- Save before making major changes

### Use "I'm Done Editing" Properly
- **Always click it** when you're completely finished
- **Don't click it** if you plan to continue editing soon
- **Remember** - Office becomes read-only after clicking

### Collaboration Etiquette
- **Communicate with your team** about who's editing what
- **Don't keep documents open** unnecessarily
- **Finish editing sessions promptly** so others can work

### Working Offline
- You can work offline - changes sync when you reconnect
- Save frequently when you're back online
- Avoid having multiple people edit the same document offline
