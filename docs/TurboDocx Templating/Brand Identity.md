# Brand Identity

## Why Brand Identity Matters

Your brand is one of your most valuable business assets. Whether you're a law firm, consulting agency, or enterprise organization, consistent branding across all client-facing documents:

- **Builds trust and professionalism** - clients immediately recognize your materials
- **Saves time and reduces errors** - eliminates manual formatting and brand guideline violations  
- **Ensures compliance** - automatically enforces corporate brand standards across all teams
- **Increases efficiency** - setup once, apply everywhere automatically

TurboDocx's Brand Identity feature allows you to configure organization-wide branding settings that apply consistently across all your document templates. Unlike template-specific font embedding, Brand Identity creates tenant-wide standards for colors, typography, and styling that ensure brand consistency across all generated documents.

- [ ] **Brand color codes** (hex codes if you have them, or we'll extract from your logo)
- [ ] **A few minutes** for initial setup

- **Additional Colors**: Supporting colors found in your logo

The extracted colors appear in the **Brand Colors** section on the left-hand side of the interface.

## Typography & Font Configuration

### Quick Setup Options

For rapid configuration, use the **Quick Setup** presets:

1. **Preset Sizes** for Headings 1–3:
   - **Small**: Conservative sizing for formal documents (H1: 16pt, H2: 14pt, H3: 12pt)
   - **Normal**: Balanced sizing for most use cases (H1: 18pt, H2: 16pt, H3: 14pt)
   - **Large**: Bold sizing for impactful presentations (H1: 22pt, H2: 18pt, H3: 16pt)

2. **Apply Presets**:
   - Select your preferred preset
   - Changes apply immediately to H1, H2, and H3 headings in preview panel
   - You can still make granular adjustments afterward

**Stop here if**: You're satisfied with the preset sizes and want to keep setup simple.

### Granular Typography Adjustments

For precise control, expand the typography accordions:

#### Headings (H1, H2, H3)

![Heading Configuration Controls](/img/brandidentity/HeadingConfig.png)

**For each heading level, configure:**
- **Font Size**: Adjust size in points or pixels
- **Font Color**: Choose from brand colors or custom colors

**Best Practices:**
- Maintain clear hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3 in size
- Use consistent color schemes across heading levels
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

#### Body Text Configuration

**Configure body text settings:**
- **Font Size**: Optimal reading size (typically 11-12pt for documents)
- **Font Color**: Usually darker colors for readability

## Table Styling Configuration

Customize how tables appear in your documents:

### Table Background Colors

### Header & Subheader Styling

**Table Headers:**

- Consider print-friendly colors for documents that may be printed

### Border & Text Styling

- **Table Border Color**: Outline color for the entire table
- **Cell Border Color**: Internal grid line colors
- **Border Width**: Thin, medium, or thick border options

**Text Colors (Optional):**

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Logo Won't Upload

**Is your file under 5MB?**
- ❌ **No**: Compress your logo file or use a smaller version
- ✅ **Yes**: Continue to format check

**Is your file PNG or JPG format?**
- ❌ **No**: Convert your logo to PNG or JPG format
- ✅ **Yes**: Check image resolution (should be 200x200px or larger)

### Problem: Colors Aren't Extracting Well

**Does your logo have multiple distinct colors?**
- ❌ **No (monochrome/single color)**: Use manual color override to add your brand colors
- ✅ **Yes**: Continue to contrast check

**Are colors in your logo high contrast?**
- ❌ **No (subtle/low contrast)**: Use manual color override for better results
- ✅ **Yes**: Try a higher resolution logo or manual override specific colors

### Problem: Changes Not Appearing

**Are changes showing in the preview panel?**
- ❌ **No**: Refresh the page and try again
- ✅ **Yes**: Changes may take a few minutes to apply to generated documents

**Did you click "Save Changes"?**
- ❌ **No**: Click Save Changes to apply your brand settings
- ✅ **Yes**: Generate a test document to verify settings are applied

### Template Application Issues

**Brand Settings Not Applying:**
