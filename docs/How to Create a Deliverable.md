  
Now that you have a Template and entries in your Knowledgebases, let's put it all together and create your first document or what we call a Deliverable. 

## Step 1: Getting to and Selecting your Deliverable

Let's get you to your Templates and select the template for your first Deliverable.  

1. On the left hand side click on the Templates tab.
2. Next select the template you want to use. If you have folders set up or pages of templates that makes it hard to find the template you want don't forget the search feature!
3. Now that you've opened your template it should look something like the second image below. Here you can check to make sure all your variables are there and also have a preview of the template to make sure you have the right document. If everything looks correct, you can go ahead and click "Create Deliverable

## Step 2: Creating your Deliverable

After you've clicked "Create Deliverable" you will be brought to a new page where you will be able to enter and edit all your variables.
There are multiple ways to enter and edit your variables so for Step 2 we will break it down into 3 parts: Simple Text Entries, Non-Simple Text Entries, Enabling and Disabling Variable, and Variable Stacking. 

### Simple Text Entries

In this first example we will be using simple text entries. Things such as "CustomerName" or "ProjectName" already have formating in the template so just clicking on the box and typing your entry will be sufficient for us here.

### Non-Simple Text Entries

What happens if we need a more robust entry? Maybe we want something from our Knowledgebases entries, an image or just add some formating to the text. We'll go through each option in this section. 

First what we will do is click the more options or the triple dot button located next to the variable boxes
