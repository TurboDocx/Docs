  
Now that you have a Template and entries in your Knowledgebases, let's put it all together and create your first document or what we call a Deliverable. 

## Step 1: Getting to and Selecting your Deliverable

Let's get you to your Templates and select the template for your first Deliverable.  

1. On the left hand side click on the Templates tab.
2. Next select the template you want to use. If you have folders set up or pages of templates that makes it hard to find the template you want don't forget the search feature!
3. Now that you've opened your template it should look something like the second image below. Here you can check to make sure all your variables are there and also have a preview of the template to make sure you have the right document. If everything looks correct, you can go ahead and click "Create Deliverable

## Step 2: Creating your Deliverable

After you've clicked "Create Deliverable" you will be brought to a new page where you will be able to enter and edit all your variables.
There are multiple ways to enter and edit your variables so for Step 2 we will break it down into 3 parts: Simple Text Entries, Non-Simple Text Entries, Disabling Variable, and Variable Stacking. 

### Simple Text Entries

In this first example we will be using simple text entries. Things such as "CustomerName" or "ProjectName" already have formating in the template so just clicking on the box and typing your entry will be sufficient for us here.

### Non-Simple Text Entries

What happens if we need a more robust entry? Maybe we want something from our Knowledgebases entries, an image or just add some formating to the text. We'll go through each option in this section. 

1. First, what we will do is click the more options or the triple dot button located next to the variable boxes. Here you will see all the options we just discussed and more.

2. Next, please select the the option you would like to utilize. 

  #### Lookup 
  For something from your Knowledgebases click Lookup. A new popup window will have all of your entries in the Knowledgebases. Here you can scroll through your entries or search for them. With the search feature it will look through the name, tags and content using the keyword. The content will be shown on the rightmost column and for larger entries you can click on the eye to see a preview. When you've found your entry, click the blue select button to on the right. 
  Note: You will still be able to edit the variable if you need to change some details from the Knowledgebases entry. For simple text click on the box with the content and change it. For larger entries click the pencil and paper to edit the content.

  #### Image 
  For images, click Image after the more options button. A pop up will come up where you can drag and drop an image or click on to choose from your file browser.

  #### Rich Text
  For text that you need to format, or if you'd like to add a table you will click on Rich Text. A new window will pop-up as shown in the image below. Here you will see familiar options such as text formats, colors as well as the ability to add tables among other things.

  #### Date
  If you click on Date, a calendar will pop-up under the variable where you can then use to select the date you would like used.

### Variable Stack and Disable Variable

Sometimes you will need more than one entry for a given variable and others you will not need a certain variable at all. These two options will allow you to do that. 

  #### Variable Stack
  What if you need more than one Knowledgebases entry or multiple images for a certain section of your Deliverable. Variable stack will allow you to do that. Simply click on the more options button and click "Create Variable Stack".
