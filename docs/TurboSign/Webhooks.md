# Webhooks

Webhooks enable your application to receive real-time notifications when important events occur in TurboSign. Instead of polling for changes, webhooks push event data to your specified endpoints immediately when signature documents are completed or voided.

![Get It Signed button on TurboDocx homepage](/img/webhooks/webhook-schema.png)

## Overview

TurboSign webhooks provide a robust and secure way to integrate document signature events into your existing workflows. When configured, webhooks will automatically send HTTP POST requests to your specified URLs whenever subscribed events occur.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive instant updates when documents are signed or voided
- **Multiple URLs**: Configure up to 5 webhook URLs per configuration
- **Secure Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification ensures webhook authenticity
- **Reliable Delivery**: Automatic retry logic with up to 3 attempts per webhook
- **Delivery History**: Track and replay webhook deliveries with detailed logs
- **Event Filtering**: Subscribe only to the events you need

## Configuration

### Setting Up Webhooks

Webhooks can be configured through the TurboSign interface in your organization settings.

1. **Go to the Turbodocx Home Page and click on settings**
   - click on the settings on the sidemenu

![Get It Signed button on TurboDocx homepage](/img/webhooks/core-features-section.png)

4. **Add Webhook URLs**
   - Enter your webhook endpoint URL(s)
   - You can add up to 5 different URLs
   - Each URL will receive all subscribed events
   - URLs must use HTTPS for production environments

![Get It Signed button on TurboDocx homepage](/img/webhooks/signature-webhook-config.png)

5. **Select Events to Subscribe**
   - Choose which events should trigger webhooks:
     - **Signature Document Completed**: Triggered when all signers have completed signing
     - **Signature Document Voided**: Triggered when a document is voided/cancelled

![Get It Signed button on TurboDocx homepage](/img/webhooks/signature-webhook-config.png)

6. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save Configuration" to activate your webhooks
   - Your webhook secret key will be displayed (only shown once for new configurations)
   - **Important**: Copy and securely store your webhook secret - it won't be shown again

### Managing Webhook Configuration

#### Viewing Delivery History

The Delivery History tab shows all webhook delivery attempts with detailed information:

- **Event Type**: The type of event that triggered the webhook
- **HTTP Status**: Response status code from your endpoint
- **Attempts**: Number of delivery attempts made
- **Timestamps**: When the webhook was created and last updated
- **Actions**: View details or replay failed deliveries

![Get It Signed button on TurboDocx homepage](/img/webhooks/delivery-history.png)

#### Webhook Secret Management

Your webhook secret is used to verify that webhooks are genuinely from TurboDocx:

- **Initial Generation**: A secret is automatically generated when you create a webhook configuration
- **Security**: The secret is only shown in full immediately after generation or regeneration
- **Regeneration**: You can regenerate the secret at any time if compromised
- **Display**: After initial viewing, only a masked version (first 3 + \*\*\* + last 3 characters) is shown

## Signature Verification

Every webhook request includes an `x-turbodocx-signature` header that you should verify to ensure the webhook is genuinely from TurboDocx.

### How It Works

1. TurboDocx creates a signature using HMAC-SHA256
2. The signature is computed from: `timestamp + "." + request_body`
3. The signature is sent in the `x-turbodocx-signature` header
4. Your endpoint verifies this signature using your webhook secret

### Verification Headers

Each webhook request includes these headers:

| Header                    | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-TurboDocx-Signature`   | HMAC signature for verification (format: `sha256=<hex>`) |
| `X-TurboDocx-Timestamp`   | Unix timestamp when the webhook was sent                 |
| `X-TurboDocx-Event`       | The event type that triggered this webhook               |
| `X-TurboDocx-Delivery-Id` | Unique ID for this delivery attempt (for idempotency)    |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Always verify signatures**: Never process webhooks without verifying the signature
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS endpoints in production
3. **Store secrets securely**: Keep webhook secrets in environment variables or secure vaults
4. **Implement timestamp validation**: Reject webhooks with timestamps older than 5 minutes
5. **Use timing-safe comparison**: Prevent timing attacks when comparing signatures
6. **Handle retries idempotently**: Use the `X-TurboDocx-Delivery-Id` to prevent duplicate processing
7. **Respond quickly**: Return 200 OK immediately and process webhooks asynchronously
8. **Log failures**: Keep logs of signature verification failures for security monitoring

## Delivery & Retries

### Delivery Behavior

- **Timeout**: Each delivery attempt has a 10-second timeout
- **Success Criteria**: Only HTTP 2xx status codes are considered successful
- **Retry Logic**: Failed deliveries are automatically retried up to 3 times
- **Retry Schedule**: Exponential backoff between retry attempts
- **Delivery Order**: Webhooks are delivered to all configured URLs in parallel

### Handling Failures

When a webhook delivery fails:

1. **Automatic Retries**: The system will automatically retry failed deliveries
2. **Delivery History**: All attempts are logged in the delivery history
3. **Manual Replay**: You can manually replay failed deliveries from the UI
4. **Error Details**: Response status codes and error messages are captured

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of delivery details dialog -->
<!-- Screenshot placeholder: Delivery details showing error message and response -->

### Best Practices for Your Endpoint

1. **Return 200 OK quickly**: Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeouts
2. **Implement idempotency**: Handle duplicate deliveries gracefully
3. **Queue for processing**: Use a message queue for reliable processing
4. **Monitor your endpoint**: Set up alerting for webhook processing failures
5. **Handle all event types**: Be prepared for new event types in the future

## Testing Webhooks

### Using the Test Feature

You can test your webhook configuration before going live:

1. **Configure your webhook** with your test endpoint URL
2. **Save the configuration** to activate it
3. **Create a test signature document** and complete the signing process
4. **Check the Delivery History** to verify successful delivery
5. **Verify your endpoint** received and processed the webhook correctly

### Development Tools

For local development, consider using:

- **ngrok**: Expose your local server to receive webhooks
- **Webhook.site**: Test webhook payloads without writing code
- **RequestBin**: Inspect webhook requests in real-time
- **Postman**: Simulate webhook requests for testing

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Signature verification is working correctly
- [ ] Timestamp validation is implemented
- [ ] All event types are handled
- [ ] Error handling is in place
- [ ] Retry logic is handled idempotently
- [ ] Logs capture webhook processing details

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Symptoms**: Events occur but webhooks aren't triggered

**Solutions**:

- Verify webhook configuration is saved and active
- Check that you've subscribed to the correct events
- Ensure your endpoint URL is correct and accessible
- Review the Delivery History for error messages

#### Signature Verification Failing

**Symptoms**: 401 Unauthorized responses from your endpoint

**Solutions**:

- Ensure you're using the raw request body (not parsed JSON)
- Verify the webhook secret matches exactly
- Check that header names are lowercase in your code
- Confirm timestamp validation isn't too strict

#### Timeouts

**Symptoms**: Webhook deliveries show timeout errors

**Solutions**:

- Return 200 OK immediately, process asynchronously
- Optimize endpoint performance
- Check network connectivity and firewall rules
- Consider increasing server resources

#### Duplicate Deliveries

**Symptoms**: Same event processed multiple times

**Solutions**:

- Implement idempotency using `X-TurboDocx-Delivery-Id`
- Store processed event IDs temporarily
- Use database constraints to prevent duplicates
