To use TurboSign effectively, you'll need:

<br/>

## Step 1: Click "Get It Signed"

Let's start by getting to TurboSign from your main dashboard.

From the **TurboDocx homepage**, look for the **"Get It Signed"** button and click it. This will take you directly to **TurboSign** where all the magic happens.

</div>

<br/>

## Step 2: Start a New Signature Request

Now that you're in TurboSign, it's time to create your first signature request.

In the **top right corner** of the TurboSign interface, you'll see a **"New Signature"** button. Click it to begin preparing your document for signatures.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

<br/>

## Step 3: Upload or Select a Document

Time to choose your document! TurboSign gives you two convenient options:

### Option A: Upload a New Document
**Upload a new document** from your computer by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping your file.

**Supported formats:**
- PDF files (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)
- Other common document formats

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>
  Screenshot: Document upload interface
</div>

### Option B: Select an Existing Deliverable
**Select an existing deliverable** you've already created within TurboDocx. This is perfect if you've already generated a document and want to get it signed.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

</div>

<br/>

:::tip Document Tips
- **PDF files work best** for consistent formatting across all devices
- **Keep file sizes reasonable** (under 10MB) for faster loading
- **Make sure your document is final** before uploading - you can't edit content after this step
:::

<br/>

## Step 4: Add Document Details

Now let's add some important information about your document.

Fill in the required information:

### Document Name (Required)
Give your document a clear, descriptive name. This will help you and your recipients identify the document easily.

**Good examples:**
- "Q3 Marketing Agreement - ABC Corp"
- "Employment Contract - John Smith"
- "Service Agreement - Project Alpha"

### Description (Optional)
Add a brief description to provide context for your recipients. This appears in the signature request email.

**Good examples:**
- "Please review and sign this quarterly marketing agreement"
- "New employee contract for review and signature"
- "Service agreement for the upcoming project"

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

<br/>

## Step 5: Add Recipients

Time to add the people who need to sign your document. This is where you control who signs and in what order.

### Adding Recipients

**Click "Add Recipient"** to assign others to sign the document. You can add multiple recipients as needed.

For each recipient, you'll need:
- **Full name** (as it should appear on the signature)
- **Email address** (where they'll receive the signature request)
- **Role** (if applicable - like "Client", "Contractor", etc.)

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

### Including Yourself

**Click "Include Me"** if you also need to sign the document. This adds you to the recipient list automatically.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>
  Screenshot: "Include Me" button and recipient list
</div>

### Setting Signing Order

**Drag to change the signing order** if it matters for your document. The signing order determines who gets the document first.

**When order matters:**
- Legal documents that require witness signatures
- Contracts where one party must sign before the other
- Documents with approval workflows

**When order doesn't matter:**
- Simple agreements between equal parties
- Documents where all parties can sign simultaneously

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

</div>

<br/>

:::tip Recipient Best Practices
- **Use professional email addresses** for business documents
- **Double-check email addresses** - typos mean delayed signatures
- **Add yourself first** if you need to sign before others
- **Keep signing order simple** unless legally required
:::

<br/>

## Step 6: Continue to Field Placement

Almost there! Now we'll move to the most important part - telling TurboSign exactly where signatures and other information should go.

**Click "Continue"** in the bottom right corner to move to the field placement interface. This is where you'll drag and drop signature fields onto your document.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

</div>

<br/>

## Step 7: Place Signature Fields

Here's where the magic happens! You'll drag and drop the necessary fields onto your document exactly where you want them.

### Available Field Types

The field editor provides several types of fields you can add:

**Essential Fields:**
- **Signature** - The actual signature field
- **Name** - Typed name field
- **Date** - Date when signed
- **Initials** - For initialing pages or sections

**Additional Fields:**
- **Text** - For additional information
- **Checkbox** - For confirmations or agreements
- **Dropdown** - For selecting from options

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>
  Screenshot: Field editor with available field types on the left
</div>

### How to Place Fields

1. **Drag the field type** from the left panel
2. **Drop it onto the document** where you want it to appear
3. **Resize if needed** by dragging the corner handles
4. **Assign to the correct recipient** using the dropdown

### Assigning Fields to Recipients

**Each field must be assigned to a recipient.** Make sure you:
- Assign signature fields to the correct person
- Place fields in logical locations on the document
- Ensure all required fields are present

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

</div>

<br/>

:::tip Field Placement Tips
- **Place signature fields near signature lines** if your document has them
- **Add date fields near signatures** for legal completeness
- **Use initials fields** for multi-page documents
- **Test field sizes** - they should be large enough for signatures but not overwhelming
- **Group related fields** together for better user experience
:::

<br/>

## Step 8: Send the Document

The final step! Once all fields are placed and everything looks perfect, it's time to send your document for signatures.

**Click "Send Document"** in the **top right corner** to initiate the signing process.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

</div>

### What Happens Next

After clicking "Send Document":

1. **Email notifications** are sent to all recipients
2. **Recipients receive** a secure link to sign the document
3. **You get notifications** as each person signs
4. **Everyone receives** a copy of the fully signed document

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '600px', height: '400px', backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa', border: '2px dashed #dee2e6', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px auto', fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#6c757d'}}>

## Congratulations! üéâ

**That's it!** Your document is now on its way to being signed. You've successfully:

- ‚úÖ **Uploaded or selected** your document
- ‚úÖ **Added recipients** and set signing order
- ‚úÖ **Placed signature fields** exactly where needed
- ‚úÖ **Sent the document** for signatures

### What to Expect

**Timeline:**
- Recipients usually receive emails within minutes
- Most people sign within 24-48 hours
- You'll get notifications for each signature

**Tracking:**
- Monitor progress in your TurboSign dashboard
- Send gentle reminders if needed
- Download the completed document when all signatures are collected

<br/>

## Tips for Success

### For Faster Signatures
- **Use clear document names** so recipients know what they're signing
- **Add helpful descriptions** to provide context
- **Send during business hours** for faster response
- **Follow up politely** if signatures are delayed

### For Professional Results
- **Test your document** by sending it to yourself first
- **Use consistent field sizes** for a clean look
- **Place fields logically** following document flow
- **Keep signing order simple** unless legally required

### For Peace of Mind
- **Double-check email addresses** before sending
- **Review field placement** carefully
- **Save templates** for documents you use frequently
- **Keep records** of all signed documents

<br/>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I Can't Find the Send Button"
**Solution:** Make sure you've placed at least one signature field and assigned it to a recipient. The Send button appears only when your document is ready.

### "Recipient Says They Can't Sign"
**Solution:** Check that you used the correct email address and that the signing link hasn't expired. You can resend the invitation from your dashboard.

### "The Signature Fields Look Wrong"
**Solution:** You can recall the document (if no one has signed yet) and adjust the field placement. Prevention is better - always preview your document before sending.

### "I Made a Mistake in the Document"
**Solution:** If no one has signed yet, you can usually recall and resend. If someone has already signed, you'll need to create a new version.
