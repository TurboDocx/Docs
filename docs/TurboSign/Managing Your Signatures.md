## Tracking Signature Progress & Viewing Audit Trails

### Automatic Email Delivery

**Good news!** TurboSign automatically sends a copy of the completed document and the user-facing audit trail to all participants via email when the signature process is complete. This means:

- **All signers** get their own copy of the completed document
- **Email delivery** happens instantly when the last signature is completed
- **Audit trail** is included for compliance and record-keeping

So while you can always redownload documents from your dashboard, you likely already have the completed document in your email inbox!

**Understanding Event Types:**

The audit trail displays two main categories of events:
<br/>

**User Events** - Actions taken by document participants:
- **Document Viewed** - When recipients open and view the document
- **Document Signed** - When recipients complete their signature

These are the two most important user events to monitor for tracking signature progress:

<br/>

**System Events** - Automated actions by TurboSign:
- **Email Notification Sent** - When the system sends emails to recipients
- **Document Digitally Signed by TurboSign** - When TurboSign applies digital signatures
- **Document Updated** - When the document is modified or updated via signature
- **Document Sent** - When the document is initially distributed for signature
