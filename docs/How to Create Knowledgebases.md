## Step 2: Enter the Information


After clicking "New", a new window should pop-up on the right side of your screen. Here is where you will input all of the relevant information.
1. First, name your entry. We would suggest something that will help to indicate to other users what the Knowledgebases entry will include.
2. Next, create a placeholder. Don't worry the brackets are automatically used for you.
3. In the "Default Value" box input the information you would like to use when selecting this Knowledgebases entry. Here you have a few options, if it is simple text feel free to use the box under "Default Value" to type in the info. If you would like to format the text or add images or dates use the more options button (or the triple dot button) to choose from those selections.
4. Lastly, press the "Submit" button on the bottom right of the page.


:::tip


- Although "Tags" and "Add Description" are optional, this can help others find and understand the purpose of the entry quickly and easily.
- If the "Placeholder" is the same as a variable used in the Template TurboDocx will automatically place the Knowledgebases entry in that variable slot. Of course, you will still be able to change it.

## Step 3: Search


Once you've clicked the "Submit" button you should go back to the main Knowledgebases screen.


From here you can add new entries, delete outdated or uneeded entries, manage your tags, or search for a specific entry. Note: When searching TurboDocx will look for the keyword in the name, tags and content!
