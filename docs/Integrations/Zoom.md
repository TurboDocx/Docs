The Zoom integration in TurboDocx allows you to automatically import meeting transcripts from your Zoom cloud recordings and use them to generate personalized documents. This powerful integration streamlines your workflow by eliminating the need to manually copy and paste meeting content, enabling you to create professional documents, summaries, and reports directly from your Zoom meetings.


## Overview

With the Zoom integration, you can:

- **Import Meeting Transcripts**: Automatically access transcripts from your Zoom cloud recordings
- **Generate Documents**: Use meeting content to populate templates and create deliverables  
- **Streamline Workflows**: Reduce manual work by directly connecting meeting data to document generation
- **Maintain Security**: All integrations use secure authentication and respect your Zoom privacy settings

<br/>

## Before You Begin

To use the Zoom integration, you'll need:

- A Zoom account with **cloud recording** enabled
- Administrative access to create a Zoom app (or assistance from your IT team)
- Meeting recordings stored in Zoom's cloud (local recordings are not accessible)

:::tip
If you're not sure whether you have cloud recording enabled, check with your Zoom administrator or look for the "Cloud" option when you start recording a meeting.

## Step 1: Creating Your Zoom App

The first step is to create a Zoom app that will allow TurboDocx to access your meeting transcripts. Don't worry - this is a one-time setup process that we'll walk you through step by step. <br/>

### Navigate to the Zoom Marketplace

1. Open your web browser and go to [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us)

<br/>

3. Sign in with your Zoom account credentials
<br/>

5. You'll be taken to [https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build)

<br/>

### Create a New App

2. Select **"Build App"** from the dropdown

![Step 3: General App selection](/img/zoom_integration/step3.png)

<br/>

4. Click **"Create"**
5. **Rename your app to "TurboDocx"**

![Step 4: Rename app to TurboDocx](/img/zoom_integration/Step4RenameTurboDocx.png)

<br/>

:::info Why General App?
We use a "General App" because it provides the specific permissions needed to access your cloud recordings safely and securely.
:::

<br/>

### Configure Basic Information

After creating your app, you'll be taken to the app configuration page. Let's set up the basic information first.

<br/>

#### Basic Information Tab

1. Make sure you're on the **"Basic Information"** tab
2. **Leave app as User Managed** - Ensure the app type remains set as "User Managed"

![Basic Information User Managed](/img/zoom_integration/Step5UserManaged.png)

<br/>

3. Scroll down to **"App Credentials"** section
4. **Note down the Client ID and Client Secret** - You'll need these values when configuring TurboDocx

![App Credentials Section](/img/zoom_integration/Step6ClientIdAndSecret.png)

:::tip Keep Your Credentials Safe
Your Client Secret is like a password - never share it publicly or include it in emails. TurboDocx will store it securely once you enter it.
:::

<br/>

#### OAuth Information

1. Still on the Basic Information tab, scroll down to **"OAuth Information"**
2. For **"Redirect URL for OAuth"**, enter:
```
https://api.turbodocx.com/oauth/zoom/callback
```
3. Under **"OAuth Allow List"**, add the following URLs (click "Add" for each one):

```
https://app.turbodocx.com
```

![OAuth Allow List Configuration](/img/zoom_integration/oauth_allowlist.png)

<br/>

### Configure Scopes

Now we need to set up the permissions (scopes) that allow TurboDocx to access your cloud recordings.

<br/>

#### Scopes Tab

1. In the left bar, click on the **"Scopes"** button and navigate to the add scopes page

![Navigate to Scopes Section](/img/zoom_integration/NavigateToScopesSection.png)
<br/>

2. Click **"Add Scopes"** button

![Click Add Scopes Button](/img/zoom_integration/clickaddscopesbutton.png)

<br/>

3. In the search dialog that appears, search for:
```
List all cloud recordings for a user
```
Or look for the scope with this value:
```
cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings
```

![Type List Cloud Recordings For User](/img/zoom_integration/TypeListCloudRecordingsForUser.png)

<br/>

4. **Add the scope** labeled "View your recordings" (with value `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings`)

![Select Scope and Press Done](/img/zoom_integration/SelectScopeandPressDone.png)

<br/>

5. Click **"Done"** to save the configuration

<br/>

<br/>


## Step 2: Configuring TurboDocx

### ðŸ”§ How to Configure Zoom in Organization Settings

1. Go to **Settings**

![Go to Settings](/img/zoom_integration/GoToSettings.png)

<br/>

2. Click on **Organization Settings**

![Go to Organization Settings](/img/zoom_integration/GoToOrganizationSettings.png)

<br/>

3. Scroll down to the **Zoom** section
4. Click **Configure Zoom**

![Click Configure Zoom](/img/zoom_integration/ClickConfigureZoom.png)

<br/>

5. A Zoom Configuration pop-up will appear
6. Take the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you obtained earlier, paste them into the appropriate fields, and click **Save Configuration** in the bottom right-hand corner

![Enter Client ID Secret and Press Save Configuration](/img/zoom_integration/enterclientidsecretandpresssaveconfiguration.png)

<br/>

### Alternative: Inline Configuration

Alternatively, you can configure Zoom integration directly when you first access transcript providers. When you navigate to the transcript providers section and select Zoom, you'll be prompted to enter your credentials if the integration hasn't been configured yet. Simply enter your Client ID and Client Secret in the configuration dialog that appears and save your settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with your Zoom integration, here are some common issues and their solutions.

<br/>

### "No Meetings Found"
- **Cause**: No cloud recordings with transcripts available
- **Solution**: Ensure your meetings are recorded to the cloud and have transcription enabled

### "Authentication Failed"
- **Cause**: Incorrect credentials or expired authentication
- **Solution**: 
  - Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
  - Try re-authenticating by clicking "Authenticate with Zoom" again


### "Permission Denied"
- **Cause**: Required scope not properly configured
- **Solution**: Verify that `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings` scope is added to your Zoom app

:::tip Getting Help
If you continue to experience issues:
- Verify all steps in this guide have been completed
- Check that your Zoom account has cloud recording enabled
- Ensure you have meeting recordings stored in Zoom's cloud
- Contact your TurboDocx support team for assistance

<br/>

## Security and Privacy

Your data security and privacy are important to us. Here's how your information is protected when using the Zoom integration.

<br/>

### How Your Data is Protected

- **Secure Authentication**: TurboDocx uses OAuth 2.0, the industry standard for secure API access
- **Limited Permissions**: The integration only requests access to read your cloud recordings
- **Encrypted Transmission**: All data transfers are encrypted using industry-standard protocols

<br/>


## Best Practices

### For Optimal Results

- **Enable Transcription**: Always enable transcription when recording meetings to the cloud
- **Use Clear Audio**: Ensure good audio quality for more accurate transcripts
- **Descriptive Meeting Names**: Use clear, descriptive names for your meetings to easily identify them later
- **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and organize your cloud recordings

### Meeting Recording Tips

- Start recording at the beginning of important meetings
- Speak clearly and avoid overlapping conversations
- Use a good quality microphone when possible
- Consider recording in a quiet environment
