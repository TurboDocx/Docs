The Zoom integration in TurboDocx allows you to automatically import meeting transcripts from your Zoom cloud recordings and use them to generate personalized documents. This powerful integration streamlines your workflow by eliminating the need to manually copy and paste meeting content, enabling you to create professional documents, summaries, and reports directly from your Zoom meetings.


## Overview

With the Zoom integration, you can:

- **Import Meeting Transcripts**: Automatically access transcripts from your Zoom cloud recordings
- **Generate Documents**: Use meeting content to populate templates and create deliverables  
- **Streamline Workflows**: Reduce manual work by directly connecting meeting data to document generation
- **Maintain Security**: All integrations use secure authentication and respect your Zoom privacy settings

<br/>

## Before You Begin

To use the Zoom integration, you'll need:

- A Zoom account with **cloud recording** enabled
- Administrative access to create a Zoom app (or assistance from your IT team)
- Meeting recordings stored in Zoom's cloud (local recordings are not accessible)

:::tip
If you're not sure whether you have cloud recording enabled, check with your Zoom administrator or look for the "Cloud" option when you start recording a meeting.

## Step 1: Creating Your Zoom App

### Navigate to the Zoom Marketplace

1. Open your web browser and go to [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us)
<br/><br/>

5. You'll be taken to [https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build)

<br/>

### Create a New App

1. In the top right corner, click the dropdown that says **"Develop"**

![Step 1: Develop dropdown](/img/zoom_integration/step_1_develop_dropdown.png)

<br/><br/>
2. Select **"Build App"** from the dropdown

![Step 2: Build App selection](/img/zoom_integration/step_2_build_app.png)

<br/><br/>
3. In the dialog that appears, select **"General App"**

![Step 3: General App selection](/img/zoom_integration/step_3_general_app.png)

<br/><br/>
4. Click **"Create"**

![Step 4: Create button](/img/zoom_integration/step_4_create_button.png)

:::info Why General App?
We use a "General App" because it provides the specific permissions needed to access your cloud recordings safely and securely.
:::

<br/>

### Configure Basic Information

After creating your app, you'll be taken to the app configuration page. Let's set up the basic information first. <br/>

#### Basic Information Tab

1. Make sure you're on the **"Basic Information"** tab
<br/><br/>
2. **Leave app as User Managed** - Ensure the app type remains set as "User Managed"

![Basic Information User Managed](/img/zoom_integration/basic_info_user_managed.png)

<br/><br/>
3. Scroll down to **"App Credentials"** section
<br/><br/>
4. **Note down the Client ID and Client Secret** - You'll need these values when configuring TurboDocx

![App Credentials Section](/img/zoom_integration/app_credentials.png)

:::tip Keep Your Credentials Safe
Your Client Secret is like a password - never share it publicly or include it in emails. TurboDocx will store it securely once you enter it.
:::

<br/>

#### OAuth Information

1. Still on the Basic Information tab, scroll down to **"OAuth Information"**
<br/><br/>
2. For **"Redirect URL for OAuth"**, enter:
```
https://api.turbodx.com/oauth/zoom/callback
```
<br/><br/>
3. Under **"OAuth Allow List"**, add the following URLs (click "Add" for each one):

```
https://app.turbodx.com
```

```
https://app.turbodx.com/templates-beta/transcripts-provider
```

<br/>

### Configure Scopes

Now we need to set up the permissions (scopes) that allow TurboDocx to access your cloud recordings. <br/>

#### Scopes Tab

1. Click on the **"Scopes"** tab at the top of the page

![Scopes Tab](/img/zoom_integration/scopes_tab.png)

<br/><br/>
2. Click **"Add Scopes"** button

```
Or look for the scope with this value:
```
cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings
```

![Scope Search Dialog](/img/zoom_integration/scope_search_dialog.png)

<br/><br/>
4. **Add the scope** labeled "View your recordings" (with value `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings`)

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with your Zoom integration, here are some common issues and their solutions. <br/>

### "No Meetings Found"

- **Solution**: 
  - Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
  - Try re-authenticating by clicking "Authenticate with Zoom" again

### "App Not Activated"
- **Cause**: Zoom app was not properly activated
- **Solution**: Return to the Zoom Developer Portal and ensure your app is activated

### "Permission Denied"
- **Cause**: Required scope not properly configured
