## Before You Begin

:::tip For Our Technology-Shy Friends
Don't worry! We've made this guide so detailed that even your least tech-savvy team member can follow it. Think of it as IKEA instructions, but for software ‚Äî and way less frustrating! üòÑ
:::

To use the HubSpot integration, you'll need:

- A HubSpot account (free or paid ‚Äî we don't judge!)
- Administrative access to create a HubSpot app (or a very patient IT person)
- About 30 minutes and a cup of coffee ‚òï
- This guide (which you're already reading ‚Äî you're ahead of the game!)

:::warning Important Disclaimer
This process involves creating something called a "private app" in HubSpot. Don't panic! It's not as scary as it sounds. Think of it as giving TurboDocx a special key to your HubSpot data ‚Äî but only the data you want to share.
:::

<br/>

## Step 1: Creating Your HubSpot Private App

The first step is creating a HubSpot private app. Think of this as getting a library card ‚Äî it gives TurboDocx permission to check out (but not steal!) your HubSpot data.

### Navigate to HubSpot Developer Settings

1. **Open your web browser** and go to [hubspot.com](https://hubspot.com)
   - Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (Internet Explorer users: it's time to upgrade! üòâ)

<br/>

2. **Log into your HubSpot account**
   - Use your normal email and password
   - If you forgot your password, there's a "Forgot Password?" link (we've all been there!)

![HubSpot Login](/img/hubspot-integration/hubspot-dashboard.png)

<br/>

3. **Find the Settings gear** in the top right corner
   - It looks like a little wheel with teeth ‚öôÔ∏è
   - If you can't find it, it's probably hiding next to your profile picture

![HubSpot Settings Gear](/img/hubspot-integration/hubspot-settings.png)

<br/>

4. **Click on the Settings gear**
   - A menu will appear (like magic, but less impressive)

<br/>

### Navigate to Integrations

1. **Look for "Integrations"** in the left sidebar
   - It's usually about halfway down the list
   - If you don't see it, try scrolling down slowly (no need to rush!)

![Navigate to Integrations](/img/hubspot-integration/create-private-app-steps.png)

<br/>

2. **Click on "Integrations"**
   - The menu will expand to show more options

<br/>

3. **Find and click "Private Apps"**
   - It might be hiding under the Integrations section
   - Think of it as a secret menu item at your favorite restaurant

![Navigate to Integrations](/img/hubspot-integration/create-private-app-steps.png)

<br/>

### Create Your Private App

1. **Click "Create a private app"**
   - Usually a big, friendly blue button
   - If there's no button, you might need admin permissions (time to sweet-talk your IT department!)

![Navigate to Integrations](/img/hubspot-integration/create-private-app-steps.png)

<br/>

2. **Fill in the basic information**:
   - **App name**: Type something memorable like "TurboDocx Integration" or "My Document Generator"
   - **Description**: Add a simple description like "This connects my HubSpot data to TurboDocx for document generation"
   - **Logo**: Skip this ‚Äî we're not entering a beauty contest!

![App Basic Info](/img/hubspot-integration/app-logo-description.png)

<br/>

:::tip Pro Tip
Choose an app name you'll remember six months from now. "App123" might seem clever today, but future you will not be amused! üòè
:::

### Configure App Permissions (The Important Part!)

3. **Click on the "Scopes" tab**
   - This is where you tell HubSpot what data TurboDocx can access
   - Think of it as setting up a babysitter's permissions for your house

![Scopes Tab](/img/hubspot-integration/add-scope-step.png)

<br/>

4. **Add the required scopes** (permissions)
   - We need to add A LOT of scopes ‚Äî don't worry, this is normal!
   - Each scope is like giving TurboDocx permission to read a specific type of data

![Scopes Tab](/img/hubspot-integration/scope-adding-step.png)

:::warning Attention to Detail Required
This next part requires some patience. You'll be adding about 50 different permissions. It's like checking off a very long grocery list ‚Äî tedious, but necessary for the feast ahead! üõí

6. **Repeat for the next scope**

![Adding Scopes Process](/img/hubspot-integration/checked-scopes.png)

<br/>

:::tip Patience, Grasshopper
Yes, this is tedious. Yes, you need to do all of them. Think of it as meditation ‚Äî or count it as your daily exercise! Each click is one step closer to document automation nirvana. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
:::

### Create Your App

5. **Click "Create app"** when you're done adding scopes
   - Take a moment to admire your handiwork first!

![Create App Final](/img/hubspot-integration/app-created.png)

<br/>

6. **You'll see the Access Token and Client Secret (needed for later)**
   - This is super important! You'll see a long string of letters and numbers
   - leave this page open to use these two keys later

![Access Token](/img/hubspot-integration/click-on-auth.png)
![Access Token](/img/hubspot-integration/access-token-copiying.png)

<br/>

:::danger Critical Warning
This access token is like the keys to your car ‚Äî don't lose it, and don't give it to strangers!. you can always find it in this page here again, there is also the option to get fresh access tokens in case the current Access Token or Client Secret gets compromised.

## Troubleshooting

Even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry. Here are solutions to common issues:

### "I Can't Find the Settings Gear in HubSpot"
**Solution**: 
- Look in the top right corner of your HubSpot dashboard
- It's usually next to your profile picture
- If you still can't find it, try refreshing the page or logging out and back in

### "Invalid Access Token" Error
**Solution**: 
- Double-check that you copied the entire token (it's usually quite long)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end
- Verify your HubSpot private app is still active
- If all else fails, create a new private app and get a fresh token

### "Permission Denied" Error
**Solution**: 
- Check that you added all the required scopes to your HubSpot private app
- Make sure you're an admin in your HubSpot account
- Verify the private app is enabled and not deactivated

### "No Records Found" in TurboDocx
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you have actual data in your HubSpot account (contacts, deals, companies)
- Click "Refresh Fields" again in your organization settings
- Check that your HubSpot private app has the right permissions

### "The Agent Doesn't Understand My Instructions"
**Solution**: 
- Be more specific in your prompts
- Use simpler language
- Include the type of document you want (email, proposal, report, etc.)
- Try selecting more specific records

:::tip When All Else Fails
If you're still stuck, don't panic! Take a screenshot of any error messages, note exactly what step you're on, and contact your support team. We're here to help, not judge your tech skills! ü§ù

<br/>

## Security and Privacy

Your data security is important to us (and should be to you too!):

### How Your Data is Protected

- **Secure Authentication**: We use OAuth 2.0 (fancy industry-standard security)
- **Limited Permissions**: TurboDocx only gets permission to read your data, not change it
- **Encrypted Transmission**: All data transfers are encrypted (like sending a letter in a locked box)
- **No Data Storage**: We don't store your HubSpot data on our servers

### Best Practices

- **Keep Your Token Secret**: Don't share your access token with anyone
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically check which integrations have access to your data
- **Deactivate Unused Apps**: If you stop using TurboDocx, deactivate the HubSpot private app
- **Monitor Activity**: Keep an eye on your HubSpot activity logs

<br/>

## Tips for Success

### Getting the Best Results

**Keep Your HubSpot Data Clean**:
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Fill in important fields (contact info, deal values, etc.)
- Keep your data up-to-date

**Write Clear Instructions**:
- Be specific about what you want
- Mention the type of document
- Include any special requirements

**Select the Right Records**:
- Choose records that are relevant to your document
- Don't select too many records at once
- Quality over quantity!

### Advanced Tips

- Select relevant companies and contacts
- Include date ranges if applicable
- Specify the type of analysis you want
