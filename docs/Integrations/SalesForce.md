## Before You Begin

:::tip For Our Technology-Shy Friends
Don't worry! We've made this guide so detailed that any team member can follow it. Think of it as cooking instructions, but for software ‚Äî and just as tasty! üòÑ
:::

To use the Salesforce integration, you'll need:

- A Salesforce account with Connected App creation permissions (any edition works!)
- System Administrator access to create a Salesforce connected app
- About 15 minutes and a cup of coffee ‚òï
- This guide (which you're already reading ‚Äî you're ahead of the game!)

:::tip Quick note
This process involves creating something called a "connected app" in Salesforce. Think of it as giving TurboDocx secure access to your Salesforce data ‚Äî and only the data you want to share.
:::

<br/>

## Step 1: Create a Private Salesforce External Client App

This step guides you through creating a new external client app in Salesforce, which will serve as the secure bridge for your TurboDocx application.

### Log in to Salesforce

1. **Open your web browser** and go to [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com)

   - Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

2. **Log into your Salesforce account**
   - Use your normal email and password with appropriate administrative privileges
   - If you forgot your password, there's a "Forgot Password?" link (we've all been there!)

![Salesforce Login Screen](/img/salesforce-integration/Login_Window.png)

:::

### Configure API Settings

8. **Set up OAuth Settings**
   - Proceed to the "API Settings" section
   - **Enable OAuth Settings**: Check this box
   - **Callback URL**: Enter `https://api.turbodocx.com/oauth/salesforce/callback` as the callback URL

<br/>

:::tip Attention to Detail Required
You'll be adding several different permissions. It's like checking off a grocery list ‚Äî but necessary for the feast ahead! üõí
:::

10. **Configure Flow Enablement**
    - In the "Flow Enablement" section under OAuth settings, make sure only the following checkbox is ticked
      - **Enable Authorization Code and Credentials Flow**

![Flow and Enablement Settings](/img/salesforce-integration/Flow_Enablement_settings.png)

<br/>

11. **Configure Security**

<br/>

12. **Create the External Client App**
    - Click "Create" to create your external client app
    - Take a moment to admire your handiwork first!

![Save External Client App](/img/salesforce-integration/create_app.png)

<br/>

:::tip Almost Done with Step 1!
Great job! You've successfully created your Salesforce External Client App. Now we need to configure its policies and get those important credentials. ‚ö°
:::

<br/>

## Step 2: Configure Connected App Policies and Retrieve Credentials

After creating the app, you need to adjust its access policies and retrieve the necessary credentials for TurboDocx.

### Access App Details Page

1. **Navigate to your app's detail page**
   - You should be automatically redirected to the detail page of the app you just created as soon as you hit the create button
   - If not, navigate to External Client App Manager **(Platform Tools > Apps > External Client App > External Client App Manager)** and click on the name of your newly created app

![Connected App Detail Page](/img/salesforce-integration/Connected_app_details_page.png)

<br/>

### Edit Policies

2. **Locate the Policies section**
   - On the app's detail page, find the "Policies" section
   - Click the "Edit" button located below the policies section

![Policies Section with Edit Button](/img/salesforce-integration/policies_section.png)

<br/>

3. **Adjust OAuth Policies**
   - In the "Edit" view, locate the OAuth policies and configure the following settings:
      - **Permitted Users**: Select **"All users may self-authorize"**
      - **Named User JWT-Based Access Token Settings**: Select **30 minutes** for token timeout
      - **Refresh Token Policy**: Select **"Refresh token is valid until revoked"**
      - **IP Relaxation**: Select **"Relax IP restrictions"**

![OAuth Policies Configuration](/img/salesforce-integration/OAuth_policies.png)

<br/>

4. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" to apply the policy changes

![Save Button](/img/salesforce-integration/Save_policies.png)

<br/>

### Retrieve Consumer Key and Secret

5. **Find Settings section**
   - On the same app details page, Navigate to the "Settings" section
   - Here you don't need to edit anything as we have already configured it while creating the app

![Settings Section](/img/salesforce-integration/connected_app_settings_section.png)

<br/>

6. **Navigate to the OAuth Settings part under the settings section**
   - You will now see a button of **Consumer Key and Secret**
   - Click on this button

![Consumer Key and Secret Button](/img/salesforce-integration/Consumer_key_and_secret_button.png)

<br/>

6. **Complete identity verification**
   - You will be prompted to verify your identity via an OTP being sent to your registered email
   - Complete this verification step

![Identity Verification Prompt](/img/salesforce-integration/Identity_Verification_page.png)

<br/>

7. **Copy your credentials**
   - After successful verification, your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret will be displayed
   - Copy both the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** - these credentials are essential for connecting your TurboDocx application to Salesforce

![Consumer Key and Secret Display](/img/salesforce-integration/Consumer_key_and_secret_page.png)

<br/>

:::warning Handle With Care
This consumer key and secret are like temporary library cards ‚Äî they let TurboDocx read only the data you've approved. But just like a password, you don't want them ending up in the wrong hands.

Keep them private, and if they ever get shared by accident, no worries ‚Äî you can always generate fresh ones right here.
:::

<br/>

## Troubleshooting

Even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry. Here are solutions to common issues:

### "I Can't Find the Setup Menu in Salesforce"

**Solution**:

- Look in the top right corner of your Salesforce interface
- Click on your profile picture or the gear icon
- Select "Setup" from the dropdown menu
- If you still can't find it, you might need System Administrator permissions

### "I Can't Find 'New External Client App'"

**Solution**:

- Make sure you're in App Manager (Platform Tools > Apps > App Manager)
- Look for "New External Client App" button, not "New Lightning App"
- If you don't see this option, you might need System Administrator permissions
- Some Salesforce orgs might have different permission requirements

### "Invalid Consumer Key/Secret" Error

**Solution**:

- Double-check that you copied the entire key and secret (they're usually quite long)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end
- Verify your Salesforce external client app is still active
- Complete the identity verification step when accessing "Manage Consumer Details"
- If all else fails, create a new external client app and get fresh keys

### "Permission Denied" Error

**Solution**:

- Check that you added all the required OAuth scopes to your Salesforce external client app
- Verify you selected: OpenID, API, Web, and Refresh token scopes
- Make sure you're a System Administrator in your Salesforce org
- Verify the external client app is enabled and policies are configured correctly

### "No Records Found" in TurboDocx

**Solution**:

- Make sure you have actual data in your Salesforce org (accounts, opportunities, contacts)
- Click "Refresh Fields" again in your organization settings
- Check that your Salesforce external client app has the right permissions and policies configured

### "The Agent Doesn't Understand My Instructions"

**Solution**:

- Be more specific in your prompts
- Use simpler language
- Include the type of document you want (email, proposal, report, etc.)
- Try selecting more specific records

:::tip When All Else Fails
If you're still stuck, don't panic! Take a screenshot of any error messages, note exactly what step you're on, and contact your support team. We're here to help, not judge your tech skills! ü§ù

<br/>

## Security and Privacy

Your data security is important to us (and should be to you too!):

### How Your Data is Protected

- **Secure Authentication**: We use OAuth 2.0 (fancy industry-standard security)
- **Limited Permissions**: TurboDocx only gets permission to read your data, not change it
- **Encrypted Transmission**: All data transfers are encrypted (like sending a letter in a locked box)

### Best Practices

- **Keep Your Keys Secret**: Don't share your consumer key and secret with anyone
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically check which integrations have access to your data
- **Monitor Connected Apps**: Regularly review connected apps in your Salesforce org

<br/>

## Tips for Success

### Getting the Best Results

**Keep Your Salesforce Data Clean**:

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Fill in important fields (account info, opportunity values, etc.)
- Keep your data up-to-date

**Write Clear Instructions**:

- Be specific about what you want
- Mention the type of document
- Include any special requirements

**Select the Right Records**:

- Choose records that are relevant to your document

- Quality over quantity!

### Advanced Tips

- Select the account, opportunity, and contact records
- Include opportunity value and close date information
- Mention specific products or services

**For Better Reports**:

- Select relevant accounts and opportunities
- Include date ranges if applicable
- Specify the type of analysis you want

**For Better Follow-ups**:
