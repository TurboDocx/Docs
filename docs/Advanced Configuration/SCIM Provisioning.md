# SCIM User Provisioning

TurboDocx offers enterprise customers the ability to integrate System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning with their platforms, enhancing user and group management across your organization. SCIM provisioning automates the user lifecycle process, ensuring that user accounts are created, updated, and deactivated in a synchronized manner across various applications and services.

TurboDocx's SCIM implementation supports standard protocols, allowing for seamless integration with a wide range of identity providers (IdPs) that support SCIM standards. This ensures that TurboDocx can work effectively with your organization's existing identity management solutions.
